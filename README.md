To get these files, there are two ways:

1) Download the zip from code -> download ZIP                       
or                        
2) Clone this repository (Make sure git is installed): Copy and paste in terminal-                 
- "git clone https://github.com/jemish072/keplaarwebsite.git"     
- "cd keplaarwebsite" (cd here stands for change directory) 

Now you should have all the files in your system.              
                     
To check the website in your local server,     
- Copy and paste this in your terminal - "python -m http.server 8000"                    
- Open your browser and go to this link - "http://localhost:8000/"    
             
You will be able to view the environment.    
Everytime you make changes to the html code, refreshing the localhost link in your browser should refresh the changes.
